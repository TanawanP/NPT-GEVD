### Explanations:
#### Introduction
To enhance the accuracy of return level (RL) estimation, the Generalized Extreme Value Distribution (GEVD) is commonly applied in maximum value analysis. However, to extend this framework to the analysis of minimum values, a transformation of the data is required, allowing the problem of minimum value estimation to be reformulated as a maximum value problem. The classical approach involves applying a negative sign to the block minima data. Despite its simplicity, this conventional transformation method may produce negative RL estimates in certain cases, which can lead to inaccuracies and challenges in interpretation.

#### Objectives
This study aims to evaluate the performance of various transformation methods, including the Conventional Transformation-GEVD, Reciprocal Transformation-GEVD, and Negative Power Transformation-GEVD. Parameter estimation is conducted using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and L-moments (LM) methods. Hyperparameters for these transformations are optimized using the Cram√©r-von Mises (CvM) statistical test. The return levels for 20-, 50-, and 100-year periods are then calculated based on the estimated parameters.

To improve the accuracy and reliability of the Negative Power Transformation-GEVD (NPT-GEVD), this study develops advanced hyperparameter estimation techniques, incorporating a small noise addition method. The proposed framework is applied to Inter-Amount Time (IAT) data of hourly rainfall from selected stations in South Korea. The ultimate objective is to introduce a novel distribution for block minima within the GEV framework, addressing the limitations of existing methods and advancing the state-of-the-art in extreme value analysis.
